## Configuration

In [the config file](./config.json) we can set the number of daily entries per user to generate, the number of days 
before today to set the records date, the name of the stream to push the entries to, the number of users with an
administrator role, and the number of regular users assigned to each administrator we should generate.

```json
{
  "dailyRecordsPerUser": 2,
  "daysToGenerate": 21,
  "sentimentResultStreamName": "-SentimentResults",
  "totalAdmins": 1,
  "usersPerAdmin": 10
}

```

## Pre Execution

Disable the KDA application currently named `-notification-system` to avoid extra charges and the generation of unneeded notifications.
