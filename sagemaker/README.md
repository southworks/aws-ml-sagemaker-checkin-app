# Sentiment Analysis Models

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks to create the different Sentiment models that were tested in the solution.

## Pre-requisites

- Create a SageMaker Notebook instance
- Upload these notebooks to SageMager
- Open each notebook to train, deploy and test the models

## Troubleshooting

- `Couldn't call 'get_role' to get Role ARN from role name arn:aws:iam::343618571470:root to get Role path.`
  You are running the notebooks locally in your machine, instead of a Sagemaker Notebook instance.
